  - Contains all 13 tables with current structure
  - Includes all production data (students, courses, marks, etc.)
  - This is the **master/source of truth** for the database
  - Use this file to restore or recreate the entire database

### Reference Files

- **`lecturer_feedback.sql`** - Reference for lecturer feedback table structure
  - Kept as documentation for the feedback feature
  - Contains table definition and sample implementation

## Usage Instructions

### To Restore Database:

1. Create new database: `CREATE DATABASE course_mark_management;`
2. Import: `mysql -u username -p course_mark_management < course_mark_management.sql`
3. Or use phpMyAdmin Import function

### For Development:

- Use `course_mark_management.sql` as the single source of truth
- No need for multiple schema files
- All table structures and data are in one file
